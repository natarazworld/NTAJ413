      <p>  Your are responsible for u r karma...  So do not run after Sun signs , babas... belive in hardwork
          results will come either early or lately.... Consistence in hardwork is the key role for success..
          if baba can change some one fate.. why he is not changing his  fate... why he is not becoming
          richest persion or healthiest person in the world...
